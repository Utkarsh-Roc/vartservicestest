As your company or school continues to adopt eco-friendly practices in the workplace, you’ll be looking for innovative ideas to ensure your brand is a leader in the movement for a greener planet.</p>", "<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>", "<p>One way to incorporate sustainability into the workplace is with environmentally friendly corporate gifts for customers, clients, and employees. Eco-friendly corporate gifts are a great way to say thank you during the holidays or any time of year while giving back to a planet in need.</p>", "<p>But what gifts work best for your audience, and what makes a gift eco-friendly?

Send Out Easy to Mail Eco-Friendly Gifts</h3>", "<p>If your staff is fully or partially remote, or you have clients and customers dispersed across the country, make gifting easier with items that are easy to mail.

A bonus is that these gifts tend to be less expensive, so they’re an excellent strategy for stretching your holiday budget.</p>", "<p>Gift cards are a staple of any holiday giveaway, but you can take it to the next level by tucking one inside a unique ornament like a Holiday Stocking Ornament or a Scented Holiday Ornaments – two cute and thoughtful ways to send holiday greetings in the mail.</p>", "<p>Amp up the impact by choosing recycled corporate gifts that are also flat and mail friendly like the Eco-KOOZIE® Can Cooler or an Eco-Friendly Pen & Journal Set.</p>", "<p>Employees and clients will be thinking of you when they receive a Bamboo Media Stand or a Bamboo and White Marble Coaster Set in the mail for their home office.

The RuMe® Choco-Love does just that since the savory items come in a reusable pouch that is great for items like tech accessories and cosmetics when the food is gone.</p>", "<p>Reward employees with tasty gifts that will make them smile like the Happy Holidays Treat Box and the Batch & Bodega Twist & Salt, or encourage them to stay in for a movie night with the Movie Night Gourmet Popcorn Gift Set.</p>", "<h3>3.

        "body":  ["<h3>1.What is SEO in marketing? What is search engine optimization with examples?</h3>", "<p>SEO in marketing refers to search engine optimization. SEO is the process by which someone (normally a search engine marketer or search engine optimizer) will optimize a site to make it easier for search engines to index and rank web pages.The most common reason to do SEO is to acquire more organic traffic. SEO is a highly dependable way to drive traffic and generate revenue, especially for an online business. So, the need for good SEOs has been growing as every business starts prioritizing their digital customers.</p>", "<h3>How do you do SEO for a website? How do I search engine optimization? How does search engine optimization work?</h3>", "<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is a very broad and nuanced field. But, from a very simplistic point of view; SEO can basically be broken down into on-page and offpage. The way search engine optimization is done is by fixing on page issues and adding additional information for search engines using things like meta descriptions. On page SEO can also include things like creating content and adding keywords to the content of existing pages. Off-page SEO includes things like outreach and generating authority for a website by earning links from authoritative websites in your niche.</p>", "<h3>3.Does Google do SEO?</h3>", "<p>Technically from a very literal standpoint google does optimize their own search engine to find better results. However, search engine optimization generally refers to you improving your site -for- Google or for any other search engine.</p>", "<h3>4.Who invented Google? How old is Google?</h3>" , "<p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin on September 4th in 1998. They are both picture above. That would make Google 21 years old now! (ThoughtCo 2020)</p>" , "<h3>5.Which algorithm is used by Google?</h3>" , "<p>Google carefully guards their algorithm. However the common ranking algorithm we know of is called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers aka BERT, which is the AI based system that Google currently uses for ranking. But, there is a veil of mystery over the exact methods Google uses and their frequent updates make it difficult to pinpoint exactly how they determine ranking. In general, it is widely accepted that Google uses a neural network to parse all the data they find on the trillions of web pages on the internet. That data is then fed into their AI to look through which websites are the highest quality and have the most authority. Those websites with the best content and highest authority are then the ones that are ranked.</p>" , "<h3>6.How do I create a search engine like Google? How can I create a search engine?</h3>" , "<p>A lot of hard work and time. Google has gone through so many iterations of their algorithm that creating something as advanced as theirs is still a reach for similar tech giants like Microsoft and Verizon; who own Bing and Yahoo respectively.</p>" , "<h3>7.How can I do SEO 2020?</h3>" , "<p>SEO in 2020 is very much the same as it has been in the past. Adhere to the Google E-A-T guidelines and create great content, build authority, and drive traffic to your website from other channels. SEO is actually easier to do as an everyday business owner in 2020 than it has ever been before. The best SEO is mostly natural and many of the most effective SEO companies these days fill a more traditional marketing role then ever. Get eyeballs on your content, get people sharing it, and make it amazing. Even without the advanced technical side you will see a lot of progress just from those factors!</p>" , "<h3>8.What does an SEO do?</h3>" , "<ul>An SEO will do quite a bit, often depending on the price point of the service providers. These can include: <li>• Optimizing content with keywords.</li><li>• Building backlinks to your website.</li><li>• Tweaking your website to make it easier for search engines to crawl it.</li><li>• Creating new content.</li><li>•And much more!</li></ul>" , "<h3>9.Why is search engine optimization important?</h3>" , "<ul><li>• SEO is important because having traffic to your website is important! It is one of the best ways to find new customers. Outbound sales is a tricky process and SEO represents perhaps the strongest inbound sales platform aside from PPC-style advertising.</li><li> • With SEO you are slowly building toward the goal of being the most trusted voice in the industry; once you are there you can constantly expand your authority and content to reach even larger audiences.</li><li>• What’s the difference between SEO and SEM? Does SEM include SEO?</li><li>• SEO (search engine optimization) is very closely related to SEM (search engine marketing). Technically they are different, though the only real distinction we commonly see is that SEM will always also include things like content creation; SEO normally does, but not always.</li><li>• We are often wary of people who say they only do SEM and not SEO. These people are often just content marketers trying to make it seem like they are SEO experts as well. But, in reality they just feed off the confusion between the terms.</li></ul>" , "<h3>10. Is SEO paid or organic?</h3>" , "<ul><li>10. Is SEO paid or organic?</li></ul>" , "<h3>11. Is SEO necessary for ranking a website in Google?</h3>" , "<ul><li>• No! Having good content is often enough alone to rank in Google. However, engaging in many of the best practices as outlined by Google is a good way to make it more likely that your work ends up being clicked on and linked to by other authoritative sources.</li></ul>" , "<h3>12.Who invented SEO?</h3>" , "<ul><li>• SEO wasn’t really invented, it was a natural extension of the need to rank that came with the dominance of search engines. So in a sense, you could say that the search engine Archie, created in 1990 by Alan Emtage, is the origin of SEO.</li></ul>" , "<h3>13. Why Is SEO Better Than PPC?</h3>" , "<ul><li>• SEO is fundamentally different from PPC, in many ways you sacrifice time to rank properly in search engines but save on your overall cost.</li><li>• PPC tends to cost more and also lacks the longevity that organic rankings provide, but you can get results quickly.</li></ul>" , "<h3>14. Is SEO still relevant in 2021?</h3>" , "<ul><li>• SEO is still relevant in 2020, SEO will remain relevant until search engines no longer exist or they completely perfect their algorithm. People need help when it comes to the technical side of showing up in search results and as long as we can help, we will!</li></ul>" , "<h3>15. Is SEO Dead? Is SEO important anymore? Is SEO a dying industry?</h3>" , "<ul><li>• There is a common misconception that SEO is dead or dying because Google made some major changes around 2016 with mobile first indexing and have since focused very heavily on their AI ranking algorithm.</li><li>• Now, that’s the reason that many people say that SEO is dead. But really, it has just fundamentally changed from where it used to be. The days of stuffing keywords and other blackhat style SEO is over, now content is king.</li></ul>" , "<h3>16.Is search engine optimization free? Is SEO free? How can I do SEO for free? How do I increase search engine optimization for free?</h3>" , "<ul>Some search engine optimization can be done with only your time. Though, SEO is very complicated and you may want to consult with a trained professional to avoid harming your website by accident while trying to do it yourself. A few tips for what you can do for free that will help your SEO:<li>• Get Google My Business reviews</li><li>• Build local citations on services like Yelp</li><li>• Have active Social Media accounts</li><li>• Write great content and put it on your website</li></ul>" , "<h3>17.Can you do SEO yourself?</h3>" , "<p>Absolutely, SEO is something you can do entirely by yourself if you have the skills, the will, and the patience needed to make it work. It’s not an easy thing to do, it requires a lot of time and patience to do it properly. So, most businesses would prefer to leave it to a professional SEO company.</p>" , "<h3>18.How much does SEO cost?</h3>" , "<p>SEO is an industry that shares similarities with the web design world, which we are pretty familiar with; you get what you pay for. SEO can cost millions or barely anything depending on what your goals are. The average SEO company will normally start their pricing right around a thousand dollars a month. That number will rise depending on the competition of your keywords and business niche. A small local business can expect to pay in the range $1000 – $2500 per month for a skilled SEO agency. But, hiring a single freelancer can cost as low as $500/Month. And believe us, you -will- get what you pay for.</p>" , "<h3>19.Is SEO Cost Effective?</h3>" , "<p>SEO is very cost effective. We normally see a much better return on investment (ROI) than any other types of advertisements. However, the timescale is normally much larger.</p>", "<p>PPC Advertising is a pretty close second and takes a shorter amount of time to begin working. SEO can take between three to six months to get started for a new company; but the ROI tends to be much higher than more traditional advertising. SEO is also compounding, the more you focus on it the more your traffic grows over time.</p>", "<p>SEO in 2020 is very similar to SEO in 2019. Make sure your page is fast, create some really great content, and avoid being spammy or purchasing links from places like Fiverr. While there are a lot of other technical aspects to SEO, that simple advice is enough to get you started!</p>" , "<h3>20.How do I choose a good SEO agency?</h3>" , "<p>Choosing a good agency requires a bit of research. You should ask them exactly how they would achieve your goals and what they would do to get there. A great agency will give you KPIs (key performance indicators), keyword research, and realistic time frames.</p>" , "<p>Avoid scammers that tell you they will rank you in a day with a one-time payment. Also, it’s important to be willing to shop around and get to know who you would be working with.</p>" , "<h3>21.How much do SEO freelancers make?</h3>" , "<p>A skilled SEO freelancer who is entirely on their own can expect to charge roughly $500 a month. However, agencies will rarely charge less than $1000. Many will charge much more depending on the competitiveness of keywords you wish to rank in. At the upper end, it is not uncommon to have clients pay millions per year to retain a great SEO agency.</p>" , "<h3>22.Should I hire an SEO Company?</h3>" , "<p>It depends on your budget! SEO is a long term investment so you need to have the money to pay for 3-6 months before you really see a significant ROI.</p>", "<p>But, if you have the means, absolutely yes! SEO is an extremely powerful tool and organic traffic is where almost all of our traffic has come from across the hundreds of businesses that we’ve had the pleasure of working with.</p>" , "<h3>23.What are Google SEO tools? What are search engine optimization tools? What are the SEO tools? What is an SEO Test? Which software is used for SEO? What is the best tool for SEO? What are the SEO tools?</h3>" , "<p>The two main tools that SEO use are Google Search Console and Google Analytics. However, they aren’t exclusive to search engine optimizers. You should be using both for any website. Luckily, we actually have a great tutorial on WordPress plugins for Google Analytics!</p>" , "<p>Additionally, there are a number of private tools that are marketed to help with SEO. The most trustworthy are Moz, Majestic, Semrush, and Ahrefs. Moz is famous for their “MozBar” which helps you assess the strength of competitors websites with a very convenient Google Chrome plugin. Majestic created the “trust flow” metric that measures how trustworthy your site appears to search engines like Google. Semrush and Ahrefs are great competitor research tools and they each have their own domain strength scores like Moz; though Moz’s seems to be the most comprehensive.</p>", "<p>But, if you have the means, absolutely yes! SEO is an extremely powerful tool and organic traffic is where almost all of our traffic has come from across the hundreds of businesses that we’ve had the pleasure of working with.</p>" , "<h3>24.How do I evaluate my SEO? How do I audit my Website for SEO? How can I check my SEO ranking? What is a good SEO score?</h3>" , "<p>There are a number of tools that can give you a general score for how likely your website is to rank. This is based on the old Google PageRank algorithm which used to give pages a score out of 100 on how likely they were to perform well in search results. Page rank itself fell out of use but a number of tools replaced it with a similar function; like domain and URL rating from Ahrefs, Moz’s domain authority, and many others. These scores can give you a general sense of how authoritative your website is. Be careful, they aren’t associated with Google so they will never give you 100% accurate results!</p>" , "<h3>26.How do I start SEO? How do I get search engine optimization? How is search engine optimization done? How can I improve my SEO ranking? How is SEO done? How do we do SEO? How can I create SEO? How do you rank higher on Google? How can I improve my Google SEO? What are SEO strategies? What is basic SEO? How do I optimize my website for Google search engine? What are the techniques of SEO? How do I make my website SEO friendly? How do I SEO my website?</h3>" , "<p>We saw a lot of different ways to ask this same question, here is what we came up with:</p>" , "<p>SEO can be quite complicated at the highest tier. However, it is very easy to get started even as a small business. Google wants to rank highly authoritative websites which have great content and follow their webmaster’s guidelines.</p>" , "<p>Your first steps as business owner are making sure your website conforms with their guidelines and hiring someone to help if it does not. Your next steps would be creating highly valuable content for your users and getting your articles shared and posted around on the web. Continue to create great content and you will be well on your way to having an SEO friendly website!</p>" , "<h3>27.How long does it take for SEO to work?</h3>" , "<p>If you have a well-established site that only needs some fixes and to add come content… SEO might start working within a few days.</p>" , "<p>But, if you are starting from scratch the process of creating content, getting authority, and ranking in search results can take between three to six months. If you’re in a highly competitive space ranking can take years without a large enough budget. This range essentially depends on the competitiveness of keywords you are targeting.</p>" , "<h3>28.What effect does SEO have on your search? What are the advantages of SEO?</h3>" , "<p>SEO just makes your website and content more friendly to search engines. This generally translates to a better result and higher position in rankings for your desired keywords. Higher positions for your desired keywords then tends to result in more traffic.</p>" , "<h3>29.How do I use Google SEO?</h3>" , "<p>Google SEO is a bit of a misnomer, most Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is done with Google in mind since they control the largest market share in the search industry. But there is no such thing as “Google SEO.” SEO is a catch-all term for all search engines. Some may differ in how they rank certain content, but they all share the same fundamentals.</p>" , "<h3>30.How can I master SEO?</h3>" , "<p>Hard work, study, and practice. There is no magic trick that will make you an SEO master. You will have to spend the time learning the fundamentals and putting them into practice on your own website to see what works and what doesn’t.</p>" , "<p>If you want resources on SEO we have plenty here . Moz, Ahrefs, Semrush, and SearchEngineLand all have great articles as well if you want to learn more in-depth.</p>" , "<h3>31.What is on page SEO? What is onpage SEO and off page SEO?</h3>" , "<p>On page SEO is the strategy of optimizing your on page elements and code to include best practices for search engines.The actual details of on page SEO are very nuanced and it includes everything from title tags, page meta titles, to how you organized your code, and beyond.</p>" , "<p>Off page SEO generally refers to the creation of links and the social sharing of content to show Google that your website is a trusted source of information in your niche. If someone links to an article you’ve written, that is off page SEO.</p>" , "<h3>32.Do videos help SEO? How does video Affect SEO?</h3>" , "<p>They do, pages with videos tend to increase the time users spend on the page, which is a confirmed positive ranking signal for Google. Otherwise, they are just good for your website in general. Users are much more likely to engage with video content.</p>" , "<h3>33.How do you rank up in SEO 2020? How does Google rank SEO? How can I increase my SEO content? How do I increase my organic ranking on Google?</h3>" , "<p>How you rank is highly dependent on the authority of your website and the quality of content you produce. Improving both of these factors will help you improve your position in search engine rankings. A great way to do this is to produce additional compelling content that encourages social sharing and linking.</p>" , "<h3>34.Do Google ads help SEO?</h3>" , "<p>Google has said officially that they do not. Google Adsense on your website can actually hurt your SEO because of the reduction in overall website speed.</p>" , "<p>However, Google ads can help when using their “Matched Content” option. Matched content can help you reduce your overall bounce rate and get more eyeballs on your newer posts that have less traction.</p>" , "<h3>35.What is the most important SEO factor?</h3>" , "<p>At the moment there are two factors that make up the vast majority of all SEO; authority and content quality.</p>" , "<p>Having a very solid, informative, and dense collection of content will show Google that you are an expert that is qualified for a high search position. In the same way, being trusted by other organizations as an expert is another great ranking signal that comes in the form of links to your website!</p>" , "<p>There are actually over 200 known ranking signals. You can see more details HERE.</p>" , "<p>What is Video Optimization in SEO?</p>" , "<p>Video Optimization is essentially SEO for video content on YouTube. Video SEO is extremely similar to regular SEO though it has more to do with specific keywords than with the depth of your content.</p>" , "<p>Oftentimes there are pervasive gimmicks that YouTube prioritizes; a recent one is having a video that is longer than ten minutes.</p>" , "<p>Video SEO can be very finicky and doesn’t really follow the same trends that traditional search engines do.</p>" , "<h3>36.How do you measure SEO success?</h3>" , "<p>SEO success is measured in the value of a campaign over a period of time. Some of the best KIPs for SEO success are traffic increases, position, and impressions. You should see a fairly obvious trend of growth for a good SEO campaign.</p>" , "<p>*Be wary of any campaigns that are solely focused on arbitrary scores on third party tools!</p>" , "<h3>37.Do keywords help SEO?</h3>" , "<p>Keywords not only help SEO, they are a totally essential part of any SEO strategy. Your keywords determine where your website will rank. For example, picking the right keyword for your area can be the difference between ten visitors a month and a hundred. Keywords are a cornerstone of good SEO!</p>"],

Y+ Yoga is located in one of the biggest cities in China, but all that unique marketing is paying off. In fact, the yoga studio was recommended by Culture Trip as one of the best to visit in Shanghai.</p>" , "<h3>#10: McDonald’s Bling Ring</h3>" , "<p>Source: Ad Week</p>" , "<p>How they were used:  This $10,000 ring was offered to one lucky fan on social media in 2018 when they used #BlingMacContest and tagged McDonald’s.</p>" , "<p>In celebration of new Big Mac sizes – the Grand Big Mac, Big Mac, and Mac Jr. – the McDonald’s corporate office in Oak Brook, Illinois got flashy with unique promo items they called “Bling Macs.” Be careful because you might end up getting proposed to with this juicy jewel.

Do you think if you can sell one product, then you can sell anything?</p> , <p>So if you sell apples, then do you believe you can sell oranges, bananas, and pumpkins the same way? All you have to do is throw everything in a catalog and say, “Here you go,” with a little bit of background knowledge and pull out your famous “salesperson” persona?</p> , <p>If that’s how you approach sales, and want to continue doing so, then stop reading. Walk away and stay in your bubble… far, far away from here.</p>" , "<h3>Selling Promo Products a Little Differently</h3>" , "<p>We approach sales in a completely different way and don’t want to be caught dead in believing that all products are created (and sold) equally.</p>" , "<p>For those on the other side of the metaphorical train tracks or are checking out the “forbidden fruit” in promotional products, then we’re talking to you – the risk takers and creative thinkers. </p>" , "<p>We want to give you some sales tips we’ve found through the years, because we’ve been around for a while (*cough, cough* since 1938 *cough, cough*). Yes, we are a little old, but that means we</p>" , "<ol><li>Have a niche</li> <li>We’re experienced and know what we are doing</li></ol>" , "<h3>7 Promotional Product Selling Tips: How to Sell Custom</h3>" , "<p> Here are 7 tips that we suggest taking a look at, especially if you want to break out of the transactional promo field and into the field of custom.</p>" , "<h3>1.     Research the company.</h3>" , "<p>This might be Sales 101, but so few sales people do this before walking into a sales call. Or, the few that do some research, might not have noticed little nuggets that spell opportunity if you put the pieces together. Yes, research the usual; such as the company background, structure, and so on. However, think about custom opportunities, too.</p>" , "<p>Did you know that one well-known international pizza company has a national pizza making competition every year? Don’t you think that they might want some custom shirts and awards to hand out for this unique event?</p>" , "<p>Another thought is how the company is working with employees. Do they do onboarding gifts? How do they honor Veterans, display achievements, or promote years of service? There are countless opportunities that you can look for. Research what their company culture and branding is like.</p>" , "<p>Understand a bit about their voice, history, and branding before you walk through the door – do your homework so the conversation is more fruitful for everyone.</p>" , "<h3>2.     Research the industry.</h3>" , "<p>Some call this unnecessary, others call this Sales 102, but either way, you should give industry research some credit. You can walk in with a portfolio catered to what is relevant to their industry and understand the timing for products.</p>" , "<p>Timing? Yes, knowing that a culinary company will need a lot of branded chef jackets is good, but what about knowing when they have industry competitions or award ceremonies? Did you know that in the Insurance industry, they don’t award their sales people at the end of the year? Instead they do sales awards in the first month of hiring! They believe that it motivates more and is a forecast for their sales people.</p>" , "<p>Understanding industry standards gives you background knowledge to better advise and have a beneficial conversation for both parties.</p>" , "<p>Pro Tip: Want to take it a step further? See what some of their competition is doing. Are they doing something creative that you know you can beat and might be beneficial for your prospect’s goals? It never hurts to do research – it’s free and makes you look better.</p>" , "<h3>3.     Have a conversation.</h3>" , "<p>Please, please don’t walk through the door and just start a sales pitch. A sales call should be a conversation. Listen to their pain points and see how you can help. If you have a true conversation, you will get an in-depth understanding of their goals, needs, and wants. Having a conversation will not only be refreshing for the prospect, but it will teach you more about the company as well. People remember those that treat them as humans rather than a money clip. As the conversation progresses, you will build knowledge and a relationship. If the prospect decides to proceed with you, you now have a better understanding of who they are and their needs, so you can recommend more targeted solutions.</p>" , "<p>Solutions? Yes, promotional products are more than just “stuff.” It’s marketing, whether internal or external. Branded materials should assist companies in what they want, which can be anything from an event, new product launch, employee recognition, or something else altogether. You want to approach this sales call as a marketer, see a pain point, or problem, and recommend solutions.</p>" , "<h3>4.     Listen.</h3>" , "<p>Stop, collaborate, and listen. No, a conversation does not mean interrupting every few sentences and leading with the lowest price from a foreign sweat shop. Listen to what your prospect actually wants to talk about. You might have ideas about products X, Y, and Z, but they might be looking more for F, G, or H. Learn to listen and be willing to pivot to best help them.</p>" , "<p>Active listening is one of the hardest, but most vital skills to develop. This means everything from eye contact and other non-verbal cues, to truly listening and not just waiting to talk again. When you actually listen to what your prospect has to say, then you will be able to see if you can have a mutually beneficial relationship and understand enough to recommend useful and viable products.</p>" , "<p>When you listen to your prospect, suddenly you are not taking a “risk” to recommend a completely custom piece; you have confidence in your relationship and recommendations, as well as have built a rapport enough for them to consider your recommendation.</p>" , "<h3>5.     Be creative.</h3>" , "<p>How often do you actually get to be creative? We’re not talking about choosing a color and a little bit of stitching on a bag. We mean you and your customer are given a blank sheet of paper and the three of us collaborate together. When was the last time you could be completely creative with a prospect?</p>" , "<p>Want to be abstract and show a bell curve in an award? We can do that. Want to be literal and show a replica of their product – a sausage? Check. Need a custom bronze pig with an apron and a client name on the pocket? We’ve done that too. We can take a few words or a sketch on a napkin and turn it into something memorable and inspiring. That’s what we do for a living.</p>" , "<p>This means you can walk in and have the confidence of selling a completely custom product. You can start a conversation with a blank sheet of paper if you want. Let your creativity fly.</p>" , "<p>Who doesn’t want a completely custom piece? It’s a huge selling point for prospects and helps you standout. Which, at the end of the day, that’s why prospects come to promo product sales people, for creative and innovative ideas for branded and promotional products.</p>" , "<p>All we ask is to that you have an open mind and have fun – be creative! And that’s why you got into this business, right?</p>" , "<p>Pro Tip: Choose unique products for your portfolio that have stand-out and selling points that make you unique versus your competition.</p>" , "<h3>6.     Customer Service.</h3>" , "<p>This business is best when it is personal, not transactional. Making a connection and building a relationship with your prospect will endear you to them and vice versa. The promo products industry doesn’t need another large, faceless entity that no one knows, but just orders from. To stand out, you want to build relationships and become partners, which is the whole point of sales.</p>", "<p>So what does that mean? This means have regular phone calls or meetings. This means building a relationship. Once you get their business, keep it. We’re not saying that you have to call on these people every week (which wouldn’t be advisable anyway, since they are busy too). We’re talking about checking in to see how they are, answering their phone calls, and giving them the same incredible service you gave them when you first sold them something. That goes a long way in keeping customers.</p>", "<p>And guess what, award programs typically last for years, so if you regularly check in, you will most likely get regular award orders until they are ready to change up the design or do more. Always have great customer service so they know where to go if they have questions or if they want more.</p>", "<p>A mark of a good sales person is not just all the new business, but also retaining customers. This means you should get repeat sales from the relationships you have worked so hard to build.</p>" , "<h3>7.     Look for opportunities.</h3>" , "<p>If you’ve taken our advice, then you regularly have conversations with your customer and have a deep understanding of their business and company culture. Now, you should be able to easily spot opportunities that are a natural fit or an easy transition for them.</p>", "<ol>Here are some examples: <li>If a company does Sales and Rookie awards, but doesn’t recognize their fantastic customer service department, why don’t they add an award system for that department to show that they care?</li> <li>Does the company want to improve their attendance? Start a perfect attendance recognition program or display.</li> <li>Is this a Veteran-owned or proud company? Consider a Veteran Honor Wall for their lobby.</li> <li>Launching a new product or campaign? Give out commemoratives.</li> <li>If the company is sponsoring a competition then a custom trophy would help with brand recognition and show the company’s individuality.</li></ol>" , "<p>Being a good sales person also means understanding the full range of your product lines and being able to recognize opportunities for growth for your clients. If you would like to talk to us about our full product ranges, check out our website or start a conversation with us.</p>" , "<p>Promotional products are a fun industry to be in, but it’s a competitive arena. You have to be unique and memorable. With the impending behemoths of Amazon, Walmart, and other giants getting in or are already in the game of transactional promo products, fully custom products are where the future of this business is going. With these tips, you can be the custom products hero for businesses.</p>" , "<p>Free design for the first order. Upload your Test art job here at partnerproofs.com</p>"],
